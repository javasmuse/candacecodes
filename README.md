Here will be my portfolio

Currently - a very simple, yet useful calculator for retired pay
why: the formula for retired pay is a mystery to many reservists and hard to find, also there isn't currently one online
target audience: military reservists deciding whether or not stay in or advance, or just curious what their $$ will be
when: the design is timeless for the legacy retirement system

Portfolio - will have photo samples / gallery, about me, a several useful apps to demo my coding skills

Tech Stack - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS Light Sail
